# MaxInt

This Java class allows you to perform addition of numbers with infinite length with a time complexity of O(l) where l is the length of the longer number.

This is similar to the BigInteger class, but was written prior to me finding out about it and has a completely original implementation.

## Next Steps

Allow it to multiply, divide and add support for negative numbers
